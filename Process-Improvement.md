## 2. Current Workflow

1. Customer submits ticket via email or web portal  
2. Support staff assigns tickets manually  
3. Support agent responds within 24–48 hours  
4. Issue resolution recorded in shared spreadsheet  
5. Weekly review of outstanding tickets

## 3. Identified Issues / Bottlenecks

| Issue ID | Description                     | Impact                                             |
|----------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| I1       | Manual ticket assignment         | Delays in response, uneven workload distribution |
| I2       | Shared spreadsheet tracking      | Risk of lost or duplicated tickets               |
| I3       | Lack of automated prioritization | Critical issues may be delayed                   |
| I4       | Weekly review cycle              | Slow identification of recurring problems       |

## 4. Proposed Improvements

- **Automated ticket assignment:** Use software to distribute tickets evenly based on agent availability  
- **Centralized ticket tracking system:** Implement a ticketing tool (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk) instead of spreadsheets  
- **Priority tagging:** Automatically flag high-severity tickets for faster resolution  
- **Daily mini-review:** Short daily meetings to track recurring issues and trends
